 # CSS Advanced Project  
This project builds on the **HTML, advanced** project and focuses entirely on applying **CSS styling**, layout systems, and design precision to recreate a visually accurate webpage based on the provided Figma design.

This project demonstrates:
- Mastery of advanced CSS  
- Ability to read and interpret design specifications  
- Attention to spacing, typography, color usage, and asset placement  
- Clean, semantic, and scalable HTML + CSS architecture
